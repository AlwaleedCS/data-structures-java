## Data Structures in Java

This repository contains implementations of common data structures using Java.
The projects are created for learning, practice, and understanding how data
structures work internally.

## Implemented Data Structures
- Stack
- Queue (using Singly Linked List)
- Singly Linked List (with and without tail)
- Doubly Linked List
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Graph
- Array-based implementations

## Project Structure

## Concepts Covered
- Nodes and pointers
- Head and tail references
- Traversal techniques
- Insert and delete operations
- Time complexity basics

## Language
- Java

## Purpose
This repository is intended for educational purposes and serves as a personal
practice and portfolio of data structure implementations.

## Notes
Each data structure is implemented in its own folder to keep the code organized
and easy to understand.
